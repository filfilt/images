how to set permission for one single folder
   open the folder in sharepoint site
   Library=>Library setting
   permission for this document library
   stop inheritance permission
   remove all users permission so all users don't have permission except Admin
   then give permision for user that mean only this user has permission to access that doc.
  Thankyou for watching
